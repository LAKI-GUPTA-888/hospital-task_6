# Hospital Management â€“ Task 6 (Subqueries & Nested Queries)


## Overview
This task demonstrates the use of **subqueries** (nested queries) in different parts of SQL statements using the hospital database schema.
---
## Types of Subqueries
1. **Scalar Subquery** â†’ Returns a single value
2. **Table Subquery (Derived Table)** â†’ Returns a set of rows and columns, used like a table in FROM
3. **Correlated Subquery** â†’ Uses values from the outer query inside the subquery
4. **Subquery with IN/NOT IN/EXISTS** â†’ Filters based on results of another query
---
## How to Run
1. Ensure your hospital database schema from Task 1 is available.
2. Open MySQL Workbench or DB Fiddle.
3. Copy and execute the queries in `Hospita_task_6.sql`.
---
## Files
- `Hospita_task_6.sql` â€“ Contains 7 subquery-based queries.
- `README.md` â€“ Explains the concepts, usage, and examples.
---
## ðŸ“š Key Concepts
- **Difference from JOINs** â†’ JOINs combine data directly, subqueries run as a separate query inside another query.
- **Performance** â†’ In large datasets, JOINs can be faster, but subqueries can improve readability.
- **Correlated vs Non-Correlated**:
  - **Correlated** â†’ Runs for each row in the outer query
  - **Non-Correlated** â†’ Runs once and reuses results
